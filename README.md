# Phaser3 Slime Jumper Game

## About The Project
Our game is a simple and fun platformer game developed using the Phaser3 framework. In this game, players control a character who can jump around on platforms on the screen. The objective is to jump on slimes to defeat them, with a goal of defeating 15 slimes to win the game, all while avoiding the 3 ghosts. If the player hits a slime on the side or runs into it, they die. Also, if they hit a ghost at ALL, they die. The player can use arrow keys to navigate, and the up arrow key for jumping. 

### Built With
This project is built with the following graphics-based technologies:
- **Phaser3**: The bulk of the game, allows for the actual playable game
- **WebGL and Canvas**: Phaser3 uses WebGL and Canvas for a renderer.
- **Spritesheets**: We used a spritesheet for the main character sprite, and Phaser3 allows you to iterate through a spritesheet for the character positions.

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Before trying to run the game, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You will need npm to run the server to play the game. 

### Installation Instructions

In a terminal, navigate to the project directory, or in the folder in file explorer, right click and hit 'Open in Terminal'. 

If you do not have live-server already installed, you can do  `npm install -g live-server` and then simply type 'live-server'. This is all you need to do to be able to play the game in your browser!
